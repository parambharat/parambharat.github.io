### Code Example

```bash
$ echo "Hello, Terminal World!"
Hello, Terminal World!

$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 user  staff  128 Jul  1 12:00 .
drwxr-xr-x  8 user  staff  256 Jul  1 11:45 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  214 Jul  1 12:00 hello.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  352 Jul  1 12:00 world.md
```
